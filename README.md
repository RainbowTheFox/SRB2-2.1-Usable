# Sonic Robo Blast 2
My usable SRB2 2.1.25 source code, that can be compiled in Visual Studio Community Edition 2022+.

## Instructions on how to build
When loading the solution, open srb2-vc10.sln in the project bar.
When prompt to update SRB2's dependencies to a newer version, don't update it.

When the main project has been loaded, select in the upper left corner Win32 build if it's not set to it yet.

This should make the source code compile properly. Have fun modding!
